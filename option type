In many situtation, an option/some/none is returned, one example is the findFirstIn to determine the first match of 
String containing a regular expression pattern. the simple way to think about an Option is that it’s a container that
holds either zero or one values. In the case of findFirstIn, if it succeeds, it returns the string “XXX” as a Some("XXX").
However, if it fails to find the pattern in the string it’s searching, it will return a None.
The normal way to work with an Option is to use one of these approaches:
    Use the Option in a match expression
    Use the Option in a foreach loop
    Call getOrElse on the value

match expression:
match1 match {
    case Some(s) => println(s"Found: $s")
    case None =>
}

for loop:
numPattern.findFirstIn(address).foreach { e =>
    // perform the next step in your algorithm,
    // operating on the value 'e'
}

getOrElse:
val result = numPattern.findFirstIn(address).getOrElse("no match")
